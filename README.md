## Projects
### 🌍 International Debt Analysis (SQL + PostgreSQL)

This project uses **PostgreSQL and SQL** to explore international debt statistics from the **World Bank**. The goal is to analyze debt patterns across countries and over time.

#### 🗂️ Contents
- SQL queries: located in `/queries`
- Data (sample): see `/data/cleaned_sample_data.csv`
- Results: see `/results` for output summaries
- Screenshots: proof of work & execution steps

#### 📊 Sample Insights
- Top 5 countries by debt in 2019
- Number of distinct countries in the dataset
- Afghanistan’s debt over 5 years

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
