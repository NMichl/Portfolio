# Execution trace
- Switched to branch `analysis/codex-metrics-20250915-1624` for read-only analysis (`git checkout -b analysis/codex-metrics-20250915-1624`).
- Installed `PyPDF2` via `pip install PyPDF2` to enable PDF text extraction.
- Ran multiple Python one-liners to extract thesis text (`PdfReader`), locate key sections (e.g., `find('3.4 Data Description')`), and compute keyword counts/snippets for summary capture.
- Queried R script structure with `sed`, `rg`, `wc -l`, and numbered listings (`nl -ba`) to review libraries, functions, and pipeline flow.
- Executed Python helper scripts to enumerate functions, loops, and branches, then serialized metrics to `codex_reports/code_metrics.json`.
- Authored Markdown summaries (`thesis_summary.md`, `code_overview.md`, `crosswalk.md`) and recorded this trace, ensuring all outputs stayed under `codex_reports/`.
- No repository files outside `codex_reports/` were modified; no automated tests were run (read-only task).
